You are in the forefront of all we do, you are our voice and our representatives and we can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your time and commitment. Chairs play a key role in giving as many as possible the opportunity to serve on a committee.  Committee chairs encourage committee members to draft reports, plan programs, get involved in public service opportunities. Chairs are also instrumental in helping recruit new members to the committee and City Bar.</p>

                        <p>Our committee management page is available to the Committee Chair and Secretary and is a wonderful resource allowing you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Obtain an updated roster whenever needed</li>
              <li>See how many vacancies you have in each class</li>
              <li>See who has applied to your committee, view their member profile which lists all previous committee engagements and review their resumes.</li>
              <li>Nominate an applicant to the committee by the click of a button. (note that this does not automatically place the applicant on a committee; it notifies us that you would like to have the person appointed).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We encourage you to use the committee management page whenever possible. If you need help navigating the page, please contact Stephanie Glazer, 212-382-6664 or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sglazer@nycbar.org">sglazer@nycbar.org</a></p>

                        <p>Please keep the following in mind when making new member recommendations:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style:disc !important;">
                          <li>The maximum number of voting members on a committee is 39 (three classes of 13). There is no limit on the number of voting members on Councils, Task Forces or Working Groups;</li>
                          <li>In addition to the 39 voting members, committees may have non-voting members including affiliates, law students and adjuncts (see definitions of categories below);</li>
                          <li>No more than one member of a firm, law department, organization, or institution may be appointed to the same committee as a voting member, but there can be one voting member and an affiliate member from the same firm/employer; and</li>
                          <li>All member resignations and newly nominated members should be reported to Stephanie Glazer (212.382.6664 or <a href="mailto:sglazer@nycbar.org">sglazer@nycbar.org</a>) or through the Committee Management page.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Part of the City Bar’s mission is to equip and mobilize a diverse legal profession to practice with excellence.  Accordingly, the City Bar seeks to ensure that its committees represent a diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and lived experiences. You serve a vital role in helping us assemble committees that are as fully representative of the profession as possible. When nominating members, please consider all of the ways they may contribute to representation, including but not limited to: belonging to one or more groups that have been historically underrepresented in the legal profession such as those who are Black, Indigenous or other people of color, LGBTQ+, women, gender nonconforming individuals, those with disabilities or first generation lawyers; socio-economic background; age; past or present military service; ideological viewpoint; different practice settings; and a mix of both new and experienced lawyers.</p>
                        <p>The City Bar imposes a three-year term limit on committee service. No member shall serve two consecutive three-year voting terms on a committee. Following three years as a voting member, said member may be appointed to the same committee as a non-voting affiliate.</p>
                        <p>For other types of membership groups like councils, task forces and working groups members are likewise appointed for a three-year voting term, but may be reappointed for a consecutive voting term.</p>
                        <p>These limits are intended to ensure that chairs periodically reexamine the composition of the group to ensure a mix of new voices (meaning new to the group, not necessarily the profession) with long-serving members who have actively participated in the group’s work.</p>
                        <p>Automatic reappointment of the same members, year after year, can impede the flow of fresh ideas and the group's ability to evolve and collaborate effectively with those inside and outside of the City Bar. We encourage members whose appointment has not been renewed to explore different ways to engage in City Bar work, and to consider re-applying to the committee in a future year.</p>
                        <p>If you are having difficulty filling committee vacancies, please contact Martha Harris (212.382.6607 or <a href="mailto:mharris@nycbar.org">mharris@nycbar.org</a>) or Stephanie Glazer (212.382.6664 or <a href="mailto:sglazer@nycbar.org">sglazer@nycbar.org</a> ) to brainstorm options.</p>

                          <li>Rotating off the committee but are working on a project that will extend into the next year;</li>

                        <h4>Adjunct Members (Non-Lawyers)</h4>
                        <p>Committee chairs may appoint non-lawyers to the committee as Adjunct Members. Adjunct Members are non-voting members and do not count towards the limit of 39 members. Adjunct Members are appointed for one-year terms and may be reappointed at the request of the chair.</p>
                        <h4>Law Student Members</h4>
                        <p>Chairs are urged to consider appointing a few law student members to the committee.

Attendance of members at committee meetings should be recorded and included with the minutes. Please note that <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about/governance/association-by-laws">By-Law 5.2(10)</a> authorizes removal of a member who has three unexcused absences in any committee year, to allow replacement by someone more able to actively participate in the committee&rsquo;s work, and <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about/governance/association-by-laws">By-Law 5.2(11)</a> authorizes removal of a member or Chair for cause. Committees should provide a civil, professional environment for healthy debate and personal attacks or other behavior that significantly impedes committee operations may be considered cause for removal.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that you prepare a schedule of meetings for the entire committee year, including catering plans, as early as possible since there is a heavy demand for meeting rooms among the Association&rsquo;s 160 committees.</p>
                        <p>Meeting room reservations can be made by emailing schedules to Linda Kemble (<a href="mailto:lkemble@nycbar.org">lkemble@nycbar.org</a>) in our Catering &amp; Meeting Services Department.</p>
                        <p>Please make sure you have reserved the meeting room before communicating meeting dates with the committee.</p>
                        <p>Several committees have moved from the traditional evening meeting to breakfast or lunch meetings, or to alternating between morning and evening meetings, and have been happy with these arrangements. Rooms can be easier to get during the day, and breakfast can be provided at less than dinner costs.</p>
                        <p>The City Bar&rsquo;s policy is to encourage all committees, to the extent possible, to hold their meetings at the City Bar. Should your committee hold a program outside of the House of the Association, please be aware that it is the policy of the City Bar that none of the City Bar&rsquo;s programs are to be held at clubs whose admission policies are known, or are publicly acknowledged, to be discriminatory toward any individual because of such individual&rsquo;s actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or alienage or citizenship status.</p>
                        <p>In addition, please inform the Meeting Services Department of the date and place of any outside meetings, so we can advise committee members and guests who call or come to the City Bar seeking that information.</p>

                        <p>Committee members should be assessed an amount necessary to cover food and beverage costs for the committee year. Each committee sets and collects committee dues from its members. Generally it is the Secretary or other appointee of the Chair who invoices the members and collects the committee dues. Sometimes an individual member finds it impossible to pay the entire assessment. One method used by committees to handle this situation is a two-tier assessment, with a lesser amount required of public interest and government lawyers. We recommend that law student members not be charged an assessment. We leave it to your discretion whether affiliate members are required to pay assessments, and if so whether to pay the same as regular members or some other amount.</p>
                        <p>The City Bar now offers a <strong>Committee Dues Program</strong>. Under this program the City Bar's Finance Department will enter and keep track of your committee dues balance with monthly statements being posted to your committee's City Bar Central platform. You will still receive copies of your catering invoices so  you may review them for accuracy. Please contact the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>) if there are any issues regarding your invoices. After 10 business days the catering invoice will be considered approved and applied to the balance in your committee dues account. In addition you will be able to draw on these funds for other appropriate purposes. A <a href="http://documents.nycbar.org/files/committee_dues_check_request_form.pdf" target="_blank">check request form can be found here</a>.</p>
                        <p>If you choose to participate in the Committee Dues Program members may pay their dues via check (made payable to the New York City Bar) or by credit card through your Committee&rsquo;s City Bar Central platform. Members paying by check should send their checks to the committee secretary or other appointee of the Chair. The secretary should send the checks along with a list of the related names and amounts to the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>). Members of Committees who chose to pay their Committee Dues by credit card online should go to their committee's City Bar Central page and click on Pay My Committee Dues on the right hand side of the page.</p>
                        <p>If your committee's not already participating in the Committee Dues Program, and would like to participate, please contact the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>) to set up your account.</p>

This means listing those present and those who are not present – not who is excused and who is unexcused and not present – unexcused. An excused absence is when the member lets you know they cannot attend and has a good reason. An unexcused absence is when the member does not reply to the meeting notice one way or the other.</p>

                        <p>Each committee has its own community on City Bar Central, which is a private online group. The City Bar Central platform allows committee members to view and post documents, collaborate on reports, deliberate on issues between meetings in discussion forums, access their committee roster, post and respond to meeting announcements, send private messages to fellow committee members and so much more.</p>
                        <p>Please note only members of the committee have access to the committee&rsquo;s community on City Bar Central so make sure your membership roster is up to date and that the City Bar knows who is going on and who is coming off the committee.</p>

                        <p>City Bar committees that focus on a substantive area of law are grouped into various clusters (e.g., Criminal Law Cluster, Litigation Cluster, etc.). Clusters are groups of committees that have overlapping jurisdictions or are likely to focus on related topics. Clusters are not meant to be exclusive and committees are encouraged to work with committees outside their cluster as well. Each cluster is assigned a Board liaison. The liaison is able to provide assistance where appropriate and help coordinate the work of the committee with the interests and activities of the other committees.</p>
                        <p>If a Board liaison has been assigned to your committee, the liaison&rsquo;s name will appear on the committee membership roster. Liaisons should receive meeting notices, copies of committee minutes, draft reports and other relevant correspondence.</p>
                        <p>Please note that liaisons are not members of the committee and do not vote on any action contemplated by the committee. Their names should not be listed on any committee report or product, or on committee attendance lists; they can be listed as a guest if they attend a given committee meeting.</p>
                        <p>In the fall, the liaison brings the chairs of all the committees in the cluster together to meet one another and to encourage discussions and cooperation among the committees. In order to keep the lines of communication open, committees are encouraged to share minutes and other relevant information with the other committees in the cluster.</p>
                        <p>Clusters are also expected to think about how they as a group or as individual committees can reach out to involve fellow City Bar members in their practice area, through receptions, networking breakfasts with a featured speaker or other such events.</p>

Please remind members that all meetings are confidential and that they leave their “client hats” at the door. Meetings should be a good mix of working sessions and guest speakers. Committees should also consider holding joint meetings to discuss a topic of mutual interest or to invite related committees to hear from your guest speaker. The City Bar encourages committees to involve new lawyers and introduce them to the City Bar, so consider holding a meeting where each member bring a junior colleague or friend.</p>

                      <p>It is recommended the committee send members a full list of meeting dates at the start of the committee and follow up with calendar invites. Your committee's meeting dates can also be posted on the committee's City Bar Central platform.                      </p>
                      <h4>Sending Meeting Notices Via the Committee Management Page</h4>
                      <p> There is now a link on the Committee Management page called &ldquo;Committee Email Addresses&ldquo; which opens up to a list of the emails of all your committee members. The list can be easily cut and pasted into any email to your members. A great thing about the list is it is connected to our membership database, so as members update their contact information, the update will automatically be reflected in the list. As a reminder the Committee Management page can be reached by logging into the Member&rsquo;s Only page of the website, clicking on Locate Committee Leaders and Members, then scroll down to your committee&rsquo;s name and click Committee Management.</p>
                      <h4>Sending Meeting Notices Through City Bar Central</h4>
                      <p>As an alternative, you may want to send committee meeting notices through your committee&rsquo;s group on City Bar Central. City Bar Central allows you to gather responses to the notice in the form of a poll so you can easily check-in and see how many members will be attending a given meeting. &nbsp;This also allows you to avoid getting numerous email responses that you have to keep track of. Meeting dates may also be added to the calendar on your committee&rsquo;s City Bar Central page so members can easily see when the next meeting will take place. If you have any questions on how to utilize any of these functions on your City Bar Central page please contact us at <a href="mailto:coordinator-central@nycbar.org">coordinator-central@nycbar.org</a></p>
                      <p>Your final headcount should be communicated to Catering &amp; Meeting Services as early as possible, and at least two business days before your meeting.</p>
                      <p>                        Committees are also urged to post the date and time of their meetings on the group calendar on their Committee Group in City Bar Central. Committees may choose to use City Bar Central as a way of notifying members about upcoming meetings, rsvps may be taken through City Bar Central as well. Your final headcount should be communicated to Catering &amp; Meeting Services as early as possible.</p>

                      <p>Committee members should be assessed an amount necessary to cover food and beverage costs for the committee year. Sometimes an individual member finds it impossible to pay the entire assessment. One method used by committees to handle this situation is a two-tier assessment, with a lesser amount required of public interest and government lawyers. We recommend that law student members not be charged an assessment. We leave it to your discretion whether affiliate members are required to pay assessments, and if so whether to pay the same as regular members or some other amount.</p>
                      <p>Each committee sets and collects committee dues from its members, generally the Secretary or other appointee of the Chair. <strong>These dues may be sent to the City Bar where we will maintain a dues account for each committee.</strong></p>
                      <p>Committee members should make their committee dues payment payable to the New York City Bar and send them to the committee secretary or other appointee of the Chair. The secretary should send the checks along with a list of the related names and amounts to the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>).</p>
                      <p>If you choose to have the City Bar maintain your account, the City Bar Finance Department will enter and keep track of your committee dues balance with monthly statements being posted to your committee's group on City Bar Central.</p>
                      <p>You will still receive copies of your catering invoices so that you may review them for accuracy. Please contact the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>) if there are any issues regarding your invoices. After 10 business days the catering invoice will be considered approved and applied to the balance in your committee dues account. In addition you will be able to draw on these funds for other appropriate purposes.

The secretary should  send the checks along with a list of the related names and amounts to the City Bar Finance Department (<a href="mailto:CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org">CommDuesProgram@nycbar.org</a>). <strong>Committee members may also pay their dues by credit card through your  committee group on City Bar Central.</strong></p>

Please note that committee budget constraints make it difficult to fully cover travel and lodging expenses of guests at committee meetings.

                      <p>Committees of the City Bar have increasingly sought funding for their programs and projects from outside organizations and foundations. We have the capacity to assist you in your efforts to raise funds for specific projects through the Association of the Bar of the City of New York Fund, Inc. (City Bar Fund), which is a 501(c)(3) corporation organized in 1946 to support Association projects. The City Bar Fund is not a private foundation and is eligible to receive tax-exempt contributions from individuals, foundations and cor¬porations. All funding efforts should go through the City Bar Fund and should be discussed with Bret Parker before any outside funders are contacted.</p>
                      <p>For those of you not familiar with the City Bar Fund, its mission is to “facilitate and improve the administration of justice.” The largest public service program of the Fund is the <a href="https://www.citybarjusticecenter.org/" alt="CBJC" target="_blank">City Bar Justice Center</a>. By harnessing resources from the legal profession, the City Bar Justice Center annually provides direct legal representation, information, and advocacy to 25,000 indigent and low-income New Yorkers from all five boroughs. Clients include cancer patients and survivors, immigrant women and children, people seeking asylum, the elderly, the homeless and people facing eviction or bankruptcy, victims of domestic violence, small businesses, veterans facing foreclosure, and those in need who cannot otherwise access legal resources. The Justice Center also runs the Neighborhood Entrepreneur Law Project (NELP), which provides low to mid-income micro-entrepreneurs with the legal services necessary to get their business started off on as sound a footing as possible.</p>
                      <p>The City Bar Justice Center recruits, trains and mentors volunteer attorneys to provide advice and representation. It operates a telephone hotline which provides referrals and brief advice and serves as intake to the various City Bar Justice Center projects.</p>
                      <p>In addition to the Justice Center, the City Bar Fund also comprises the <a href="http://www.vancecenter.org/" alt="Vance Center"  target="_blank">Vance Center for International Justice</a> which provides pro bono legal advice to international social justice NGOs and human rights agencies, in partnership with major law firms worldwide. The Vance Center advises clients with missions and projects in four areas: human rights and access to justice; free speech, press, and information; environmental sustainability; and health and development. In addition, our Program on Strengthening the Legal Profession builds the capacity of law firms, bar associations, law schools, and pro bono clearinghouses, regarding pro bono service, ethics, and diversity.</p>
                      <p>The City Bar Fund also includes the <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/lawyer-assistance-program" alt="LAP"  target="_blank">Lawyer Assistance Program</a> (which assists drug and alcohol dependent lawyers or those suffering from depression) and the <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/serving-the-community/diversity-and-inclusion" alt="Diversity"  target="_blank">Office for Diversity &amp; Inclusion</a> (which coordinates diversity efforts within the legal profession and runs a Diversity Pipeline program for students considering a legal career), and various lectures, awards and committee-sponsored projects.</p>
                      <p>Project proposals submitted by a City Bar committee should contain an administrative fee to cover the estimated costs incurred by the City Bar Fund for each project, including staff and accounting support, office expenses and indirect costs. All money received for City Bar projects will be held in restricted funds of the City Bar Fund. Checks from grantors should be made payable to the City Bar Fund. Once funds are raised, as your committee requires funds for the purposes of the project, receipts and/or bills approved and signed by the chair of the committee should be submitted to Bret Parker for prompt payment.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                      <h4>Types of reports</h4>
                      <p>Any written product drafted by a committee is governed by the City Bar’s report review process, outlined below. This includes, but is not limited to, amicus briefs, letters to elected officials, legislative reports, public comments, hearing testimony, policy recommendations, surveys, FOIL requests, op-eds, questionnaires, etc. <em>See</em> the “Pre-Publication Clearance” section for more information.</p>
                      <h4>Prior Positions</h4>
                      <p>Before undertaking a report, committees should check to see if the City Bar has a prior position on the issue. The <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/" target="_blank">Committee Reports</a> section of our website provides reports from at least the past fifteen years and the Policy Department or <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/member-committee-career-services/library/" target="_blank">Library</a> can check our internal records for older reports. Committees are encouraged to contact these departments if they have trouble determining whether the City Bar has issued any reports on the topics they are considering.</p>
                      <p>The existence of a prior City Bar report does not preclude the same committee or a different committee from issuing a subsequent report on the same topic; however, the subsequent report cannot take a different position on the issue, absent a compelling reason. Committees can write additional reports on a topic provided they are updating an old report with new data, offering a new analysis from a different committee's perspective or doing a deeper study of the issue.</p>
                      <p>An existing City Bar position can be reevaluated if a significant amount of new data is presented or there is a change in circumstances that alters the conditions in which the issue was initially considered. In such a case, the then-sitting President must approve the change in position.</p>
                      <p><em>A note on reissuing reports:</em> Committees are encouraged to update and reissue their past reports when appropriate, particularly when it comes to reports on legislation. When advocating for a legislative change, it is important that committee reports reflect the most recent bill information and any amendments that may have been made since the reports' issuance. Reissued reports do not need to be reapproved by the committee(s) or President, provided no significant changes are made to the position and policies discussed; however, discretion is given to the chair(s) and Policy Department to determine what is the best approach. If your committee is interested in reissuing a prior report, please <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">contact the Policy Department</a>.</p>
                      <h4>Special Considerations with respect to Amicus Briefs</h4>
                      <p>There are instances when a court would benefit from additional insights and expertise beyond that offered by the parties in a case, and we are pleased that many City Bar committees have taken on the role of providing such guidance through amicus briefs submitted on a wide range of topics. As noted above, amicus briefs must go through the same vetting and approval process as any other City Bar-issued report.</p>
                      <p>In addition, amicus briefs involve certain other considerations. For example, although such briefs may purport to offer non-partisan legal or other arguments, they ultimately may favor one party in a matter over another. Moreover, such briefs often involve significant and time-intensive research and drafting work. For these reasons, we advise that, before submitting a draft amicus brief, the committee submit an outline of the contemplated brief or summary of the proposed arguments for review by the Policy Department and approval by the President before beginning substantive work on the actual brief.</p>
                      <p>Amicus briefs also are subject to certain requirements that make the use of an appellate printing service necessary (or at least advisable). Appellate printers are expensive—and while we want to encourage committees to file amicus briefs, as a nonprofit organization we do attempt to keep our costs as low as possible. Thus, as early as possible in the process (preferably as early as when the committee begins contemplating an amicus brief), we ask that the committee discuss ways it can help defray some or all of the costs of the appellate printer.</p>
                      <p>Cost-saving steps:</p>
                      <ul style="list-style:disc !important;">
                        <li>Discuss among your committee members whether one or some of the law firms where they work can cover the appellate printer costs for your project (sometimes a single law firm can foot the bill, and other times several law firms are willing to split the cost)</li>
                        <li>Contact an appellate printer early in the process to ensure that they offer a pro bono or nonprofit discount (many do), and secure such discount for your project</li>
                        <li>Discuss timing considerations with the appellate printer (When do they need the brief in order to process it in time? Does your brief have extensive or complicated exhibits? Will the printer be handling filing and service? etc.) to ensure that they do not charge additional fees to &ldquo;expedite&rdquo; or &ldquo;rush&rdquo; your project</li>
                        <li>Create the cover page, Table of Contents and Table of Authorities before sending the brief to the printer, rather than having the appellate printer generate them. Providing these to the appellate printer can significantly reduce costs.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>If the committee is unable to come up with a source of funding and needs to ask the City Bar to pay some or all of the printing costs, please submit a written request for approval—including a written estimate from the appellate printer reflecting the pro bono or nonprofit discount— <em>before</em> engaging the appellate printer&rsquo;s services. Please know that your efforts in all of these regards help to extend our resources and further the City Bar&rsquo;s mission and the important work of all of our committees.</p>
                      <h4>Consultation and Review of Reports with Other Committees</h4>
                      <p>Committees should feel free to initiate projects without undue inhibitions caused by possible concurrent jurisdiction with other committees. However, at an early stage, committees should inform the chairs of other committees having a possible interest in the subject being pursued, so that activities can be properly coordinated. Consulting the other committees in your cluster is usually a good starting point; for a full list of City Bar committees, <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/committees/">click here</a>. The Policy Department can also help you identify relevant committees to contact.</p>
                      <p>A joint report with another committee strengthens the impact of a report while at the same time adding valuable perspectives to its substance. By joining forces, or simply consulting in the earliest stages of serious work efforts, committees may avoid frustrating publication delays in the event of a disagreement at a later date with another committee that the President or Board of Directors might have to resolve. When submitting a report for review, committees should indicate on their <a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/Upload_Report/Members/Committee_Reports/Submit_Report.aspx">Report Intake Form</a> any other committees consulted during the drafting of the report.</p>
                      <p>If, upon receiving a report, the Policy Department and/or President determine that another committee should review it that has not already done so, the report will be sent to the committee with a request to provide any comments in writing. Depending on the nature of the report and any relevant timing considerations, we try to give committees through their next scheduled committee meeting to send feedback and/or vote to sign on  . Where there is a need for faster action or for more time, we work with the authoring and reviewing committees to set a reasonable schedule for feedback and sign-on. If a committee raises concerns regarding another committee&rsquo;s report, the President will work with the committees to resolve the matter promptly. If agreement cannot be reached, the City Bar&rsquo;s By-Laws empower the President to resolve the issue, and permit an appeal of the President&rsquo;s decision to the Board of Directors (<em>See</em> <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about/governance/association-by-laws#XIV" target="_blank">By-Law 5.4.7</a>).</p>
                      <h4>Content and Formatting of Reports</h4>
                      <p>While the content and format of committee reports will vary depending on the topic and goal of the report, all committee work should aim to be well-balanced, well-supported and thoughtful. All efforts should be made to ensure any work coming out of the committees meets the high standards of the City Bar and upholds its mission.</p>
                      <p>To help with the finalizing of reports, the City Bar has developed a general <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/committeereportsstyleguide.pdf" target="_blank">Style Guide</a>  for committees to use. Please consult this guide when drafting reports and remember to check (and date) all citations before submitting. For examples of committee reports, please visit the <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/" target="_blank">Committee Reports</a> section of our website. While we appreciate all efforts committees can take in the formatting of reports before they are submitted, please be assured that all reports will ultimately be reviewed and put in final format by the Policy Department prior to publishing.</p>

                      <p>The Board of Directors has adopted the following <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about-us/leadership/selected-resolutions/" target="_blank">resolution</a> regarding confidentiality of City Bar and committee proceedings:</p>
                      <blockquote><p>&ldquo;Deliberations at committee meetings are normally understood by the committee members to be part of the process of reaching conclusions and are not intended for public disclosure of any kind. At the same time, the subjects being discussed at committee meetings are frequently issues of public concern which are not better resolved in a total vacuum. Some exposure to the outside world of the subjects being discussed within the committee is likely to result in a better conclusion. Committees are free to and are encouraged to seek outside views, but such efforts should not be made without the express approval of the chair of the committee or of the committee as a whole. Moreover, even with such approval, the disclosure of the views of individual members of the committee, or of positions being considered by the committee, is a violation of the rights of the committee and committee members, and is inconsistent with the fact that City Bar positions should be publicly announced only in accordance with the procedures set out in the by-laws.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

                      <p>In line with this resolution, committee chairs should periodically stress to committee members that all conclusions, recommendations or reports of the committee must remain confidential until approved by the President for publication. The President requires that all drafts of reports be clearly marked on the first page with the following language:</p>
                      <p><em>&ldquo;The following is a draft report, not an approved position of the Committee or the New York City Bar, and is not intended for distribution outside the City Bar.&rdquo;</em></p>
                      <p>If the committee wishes to circulate a draft report to agencies or other persons outside the City Bar for review, please <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">contact the Policy Department</a>.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                      <p>It is generally undesirable for a committee to take any action of significance with only a small number of members present or by a vote that is closely divided (for example, a report should not be advanced to the President for approval without the affirmative vote of at least one more than half its voting membership, including the chair(s)  ). The Chair(s) is expected to make efforts to avoid such a result whenever feasible, such as deferring final action or developing alternative positions that may command greater support on the committee, without any suggestion, however, that a bare majority lacks power to take final action.</p>
                      <p>It is also acceptable to poll committee members not present at the meeting with regard to their views on a report. In using such a poll, however, please recognize that some of those responding may not have had the benefit of a committee discussion of the report; thus, such a poll should not be used to reverse a decision made at a committee meeting.</p>
                      <p>Chair(s) may choose to solicit a vote by electronic means, including, but not limited to, email, conference call or video conferencing. However, if there is significant dissent or concern raised, chairs should try not to rely on an email vote if the topic being voted on was not discussed at a committee meeting.</p>
                      <h4>Individual Conflicts on Substantive Issues Addressed by Committees</h4>
                      <p>All members of the City Bar, particularly members of committees, should take special care to safeguard the City Bar&rsquo;s and its committees&rsquo; reputation for integrity and objectivity. In general, it is assumed that all members leave their clients&rsquo; hats at the door of the City Bar and engage in deliberation and debate as individual members of the bar. Nothing in committee reports can or should be attributed to an organization, employer or client with which a committee member was or is affiliated.</p>
                      <p>However, there may be occasions when a member or members have an immediate, direct and/or significant interest in a particular issue such that their involvement in a committee report or action involving the issue could compromise (or be perceived as compromising) the integrity of the process. For example, committee members may be personally involved in litigation, a regulatory proceeding or a lobbying campaign that directly and significantly relates to the subject matter on which the committee is developing a position. In such instances, the members must always disclose the existence of a conflict (or potential conflict) to the committee, although sensitive and/or confidential information, including information that may be protected by attorney-client privilege or other limitations, need not be discussed or disclosed. In some circumstances, such members may be required to recuse themselves from discussion, research, drafting and/or approval of any report addressing the issue.</p>
                      <p>Whether recusal (and/or abstention) is required should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the potential conflict—keeping in mind the dual goals of offering and leveraging our best experts&rsquo; knowledge on the issue while taking care to develop policy positions that reflect balanced debate and deliberation in furtherance of the City Bar&rsquo;s mission (rather than serve the purpose of favoring any particular member, organization and/or client). Committee chairs may determine that the potential conflict does not require the member to be recused from discussion and/or drafting of the report. However, the potentially conflicted member should nonetheless abstain from any vote(s) to approve such report if their participation could be perceived as attempting to influence the vote to benefit the member, a client, or an organization with which the member is affiliated.</p>
                      <p>As part of the report submission process, the <a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/Upload_Report/Members/Committee_Reports/Submit_Report.aspx">committee report intake form</a> asks whether the committee has read and complied with this section, and requests the name(s) of any committee member(s) who recused (or abstained) from any part of the drafting or approval process and whether such recusal or abstention should be noted in the report (in addition to noting such recusal or abstention in the committee minutes). Questions regarding the application of this policy may be <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">directed to the Policy Department</a>.</p>
                      <p>Committees also should be mindful of Rule 6.4 of the New York Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>&ldquo;A lawyer may serve as a director, officer or member of an organization involved in reform of the law or its administration, notwithstanding that the reform may affect the interests of a client of the lawyer. When the lawyer knows that the interests of a client may be materially benefitted by a decision in which the lawyer actively participates, the lawyer shall disclose that fact to the organization, but need not identify the client. In determining the nature and scope of participation in such activities, a lawyer should be mindful of obligations to clients under other Rules, particularly 1.7.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>[Note: Rule 1.7 addresses conflicts of interest involving current clients.]</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                      <p>The City Bar is often asked to support issues by joining coalitions or signing on to the work of other organizations, such as reports, letters, amicus briefs, petitions, etc. In general, the City Bar does not sign on to work prepared by another entity or formally join coalitions/campaigns. By signing on to the work of another group, the City Bar cedes the use of its name to someone else and limits the President&rsquo;s authority under its By- Laws to approve positions and decisions made related to a position, both strategic and substantive.  However, there are some exceptions, outlined below.  Please <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">contact the Policy Department</a> to discuss these exceptions further. </p>
                      <h4>Joining a Coalition</h4>
                      <p>While the City Bar cannot formally join coalitions/campaigns, that does not preclude us from working in tandem with a coalition/campaign.  As part of our advocacy work after the City Bar has an approved position on an issue, the Director of Advocacy will often reach out to other organizations/coalitions/campaigns to share the City Bar&rsquo;s work and learn about their advocacy.  This helps us tailor our advocacy strategy and maximize our impact.  Where appropriate, the City Bar and its members can amplify the work of a campaign/coalition through their networks and social media.  The Director of Advocacy will also share advocacy alerts / action items and Lobby Day opportunities with committees that are being hosted by campaigns/coalitions where appropriate.  </p>
                      <h4>Sign on Letters / Form Letters / Signing on to the Work of other Organizations</h4>
                      <p>Committees cannot substantially adapt another organization&rsquo;s document and then issue it as a City Bar report, even if the other organization requests it and the committee agrees with the position being taken. In those circumstances, a committee should write an independent report that reflects the deliberations of the committee and contains appropriate attribution to the work product of the other organization.</p>
                      <p>If, after conducting an independent review of an issue, a committee simply wants to add support to another organization&rsquo;s position, it should write a letter acknowledging the other organization&rsquo;s position and include a brief explanation of why the committee supports it.  If it is determined that a form letter/report is the best approach for advocacy purposes, the letter/report must acknowledge that it is adapted from another organization&rsquo;s form letter/report and identify the other organization.</p>
                      <p>A committee may jointly issue a report with another organization if the committee is substantively involved in the drafting of the report and it is approved by the committee and the City Bar President. Joint reports should reflect the authorship and, if possible, the logos of all involved organizations.</p>
                      <p>Notwithstanding the above, there are rare occasions where it is advisable, as a strategic matter, to join other organizations in making a statement of significance to the profession or to a particular practice area, even if the committee does not have an opportunity to participate in the drafting of the statement. Signing on to a joint statement under these circumstances requires that the City Bar already have taken a position consistent with the position being taken in the statement, and further requires the approval of the President. If you believe you fall under this set of circumstances, or if you believe there is a compelling reason for the City Bar to sign onto an organizational statement for some other reason, please <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">contact the Policy Department</a> to discuss and seek the President's approval.</p>
                      <p>Please note that while the City Bar is limited in its ability to sign on to the work of other organizations, it does not preclude committees from participating in advocacy with other organizations for approved City Bar positions. Please see the section Report Distribution, Promotion and Advocacy for more information.</p>

Prior to release of any report or any written or oral communication that presents the committee&rsquo;s conclusions or recommendations on a substantive matter, the report, conclusions or recommendations must be approved by the President.</p>
                      <p>Please remember, if a committee wishes to circulate a draft report to agencies or other persons outside the City Bar for review that too must first be approved by the President.</p>
                      <p>When a report has been approved by a committee, the report should be submitted in Word format for review through our online &ldquo;<a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/Upload_Report/Members/Committee_Reports/Submit_Report.aspx" target="_blank">Report Intake Form</a>&rdquo;. This form allows committees to provide some background information on their work and upload a report for consideration. The information provided will help with the review, finalization and distribution of reports.</p>
                      <p>Submitted reports will be assessed by the Policy Department, which will coordinate any required review by other committees and by the President. As part of this process, the Chair(s) may be asked whether committee deliberations yielded any significant dissent or included any discussion of known opposing views and how such views were handled. If the President has questions about or wants changes to be made to the report, they will be sent to the committee. If the President disapproves a report, committees are permitted to appeal of the decision to the Board of Directors (<em>See</em><a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about/governance/association-by-laws#XIV" target="_blank"> By-Law 5.4</a>). Reports approved by the President are considered official positions of the City Bar.</p>

                      <p>Committees put significant time and resources towards crafting their reports and it is important that consideration also be given to how those reports will be conveyed to appropriate stakeholders in order to maximize their impact. The City Bar has various resources that can help with the distribution, promotion and advocacy of committee reports and positions.</p>
                      <h4>Distribution</h4>
                      <p>We encourage wide dissemination of committee reports. Approved reports will be posted on the City Bar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/" target="_blank">website</a>, provided there is no reason to refrain from posting. We encourage committees to share final reports with their professional networks and through social media to enhance the profile and visibility of the report. See our <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/images/stories/pdfs/nyc-bar-social-media-policy.pdf">Social Media Policy</a> for more information.</p>
                      <p>The Policy Department reviews all reports and, as appropriate, will work with committees to prepare a targeted distribution of their report. They will coordinate distribution with the committee to ensure the report gets to the right people at the most impactful times. While most committees know who the appropriate audience should be, we can also help to identify key legislators, public officials and other bar associations or organizations that may have an interest in your recommendations. Any committee recommendations or requests related to distribution can be noted on the <a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/Upload_Report/Members/Committee_Reports/Submit_Report.aspx" target="_blank">Report Intake Form</a> when submitting a report for review. Committees are encouraged to consult with the Policy Department before distributing any reports, particularly in cases where the committee would like to engage in ongoing advocacy or when the committee is proposing legislation, so that we can coordinate efforts.</p>
                      <p>If a committee is filing an amicus brief or submitting a report for publication in a journal, magazine, etc., submission should be coordinated with the Policy Department and a copy of the brief or report as filed should be provided for our records and posting on the City Bar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
                      <p>Please note that the City Bar holds the copyright on any committee work product and the right of first refusal on publication. That said, the City Bar understands the value in disseminating our committees&rsquo; work product and supports sharing our members&rsquo; expertise with the legal profession and the wider public. If an outside publication wishes to reprint or otherwise publish a committee report, please contact the City Bar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/about-us/staff/">general counsel</a> for permission to reprint   .</p>
                      <h4>Advocacy Following Release of a Report</h4>
                      <p>After issuing a report, one of the ways committees can stay involved and advance their policy recommendations is through advocacy. For those committees that want to engage in advocacy work above and beyond the issuance of a report, the Policy Department can help. The City Bar&rsquo;s ability to advocate for committee positions is directly tied to the level of involvement from committee members, so we strongly encourage committees to reach out to the Policy Department early in their report deliberations to coordinate efforts. <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-resources/your-committee-issued-a-report-now-what/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a brief guide on steps committees should take following the issuance of a report.</p>
                      <p>In partnership with committee members, we can help with advocacy in a number of ways, including:</p>
                      <ul style="list-style:disc !important;">
                        <li>working with committees to determine the appropriate strategy and timing of report distribution and helping to develop an advocacy plan (which may include utilizing the resources in our <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/media/" target="_blank">Communications Department</a> to publicize a report or putting on a program to educate the public about the issue);</li>
                        <li>assisting in communicating committee views to policymakers and related stakeholders;</li>
                        <li>tracking developments related to legislation or an issue of interest and providing updates;</li>
                        <li>arranging meetings or lobby visits with individuals and organizations who would be responsible for implementing report recommendations;</li>
                        <li>partnering with other bar associations or outside organizations to promote our positions and collaborate on advocacy efforts;</li>
                        <li>convening a roundtable of related stakeholders to fully air an issue and develop a plan of action; and</li>
                        <li>working with committees to seek sponsors and advocate for legislation proposed by committees.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Our website provides a number of <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-resources/your-committee-issued-a-report-now-what/" target="_blank">resources</a> for committees interested in undertaking advocacy, such as <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-resources/committee-reports-and-member-best-practices/" target="_blank">best practices</a>, <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-resources/tracking-state-and-city-legislation-tips/" target="_blank">tips for tracking legislation</a> and <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-resources/engaging-in-advocacy-how-to-get-involved-after-a-committee-takes-a-position/" target="_blank">ways to get involved in advocacy</a>. Committees can also use our <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issue-policy" target="_blank">website</a> and social media sites to receive news updates relevant to the City Bar&rsquo;s policy work, learn when reports are posted on the web, and get updates on the status of bills they&rsquo;ve commented on.</p>
                      <p>For more information, please <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/issues-policy/policy-department-about-us/">contact</a> the City Bar&rsquo;s Director of Advocacy.</p>
                      <h4>Committee Programs</h4>
                      <p>Organizing a program through the City Bar is another way to promote the ideas and issues in committee reports. Committees should consider planning CLE courses or educational events that highlight the topics in their reports. Creating a public forum where experts, advocates and other interested parties can have an open dialogue on an issue or newly enacted legislation provides an excellent opportunity to educate the profession and public and create interest in the topic. If you are interested in hosting an event at the City Bar, see the Programs section of the Handbook.</p>

                      <p>Many reports are appropriate subjects for publicity. Committees should work with the <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/media/" target="_blank">Communications Department</a> to develop a strategy to draw media attention. To ensure the best possible coverage for reports and recommendations, please fill out all sections of the <a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/Upload_Report/Members/Committee_Reports/Submit_Report.aspx" target="_blank">Report Intake Form</a> and provide the Communications Department with the names of reporters and publications that you may wish to alert (Communications will also utilize the City Bar&rsquo;s media contacts and resources). Committees hoping for significant media coverage should contact Communications early in the drafting stages to optimize later press coverage.</p>
                      <p>Committees are encouraged to prepare op-ed pieces (up to 650 words) and letters to the editor (up to 150 words) to draw further attention to reports. As with any committee report, op-ed pieces or letters to the editor must be approved by the President, even when writing about approved City Bar positions. In order to provide maximum assistance and coordination, press releases, op-ed pieces and letters to the editor will be released only from the Communications Department or with its supervision. If a committee chair or member is writing an article or op-ed piece in her/his own name and not in their capacity as chair or member, they should not identify an affiliation with the City Bar, so as to avoid confusion as to whether the piece is presenting the City Bar&rsquo;s positions.</p>
                      <p>You can also work with the Communications Department to create a <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/podcasts/">podcast</a> that highlights the topic of your report. Similar to hosting an event, podcasts provide a flexible and unique format for showcasing an issue.</p>
                      <p>The City Bar frequently receives calls from the media asking for background information or for City Bar positions on a wide variety of legal issues. These calls are handled through the Communications Department and are an excellent opportunity to call attention to a committee&rsquo;s work on an issue. Committee chairs, or their designees, are expected to be available to the press not only to discuss committee reports, but also to advise reporters on subjects within the committee&rsquo;s expertise. Please try to answer these requests in a timely manner, as deadlines are typically tight. If for some reason chairs are unable to handle the particular issue, they should refer it to someone on their committee who can.</p>
                      <p>When speaking with the media, committee members should be aware of their role as a spokesperson. If discussing a committee report or commenting on an issue about which the City Bar has an official position, members should be represented as &ldquo;Chair or member of the New York City Bar&rsquo;s Committee on .........&rdquo; If a committee member is providing general background, they also can be identified with the City Bar. However, if a member is giving an opinion on an issue about which the City Bar does not have an official position, they are speaking as an individual and should be represented as such, without their City Bar affiliation.</p>

                       <li>Committee Chairs may give preference to active committee members and NYC Bar members when choosing a program chair(s) or speaker(s) for a program. The NYC Bar encourages  varying program chairs and speakers from year-to-year on programs that are repeated. Additionally, all attorney speakers must be in good standing with the state bar they are admitted in.</li>

Please email or otherwise send the request to Martha Harris, <a href="mailto:mharris@nycbar.org">mharris@nycbar.org</a>, 212-382-6607. Approval must be obtained prior to offering reimbursement to any speakers. Appropriate receipts must be attached to any request for reimbursement.</li>

                     <p>The City Bar hosts events, both in person and virtually, throughout the day. When planning a program please consider the optimal platform (in person or virtual) and time of day based on anticipated audience, speaker availability, length of the program, etc. We are happy to speak with you to review all the options. One to two hours is the usual and recommended length of most non-CLE events.</p>
                    <p>If planning a reception, please consider the timing as well. Receptions can be held before or after the program. The start time of the program will typically dictate which is optimal. Receptions typically run 30 minutes to one hour in length. If planning a reception, it is important to consider early on in the program planning process how the cost will be covered, for example by attendee fees or by sponsorship. See Charging for Events and the Sponsorship sections below for more information.</p>
                    <p>All programs and receptions should end no later than 8:30 pm, unless an exception is approved by the Senior Director of Programs, <a href="mailto:mharris@nycbar.org">Martha Harris</a>. When hosting a post program reception, please understand that if the program runs long, we cannot automatically extend the end time of the reception. So please be sure to begin and end the program on time."</p>

                       <li>Because the subject matter of a given program typically will involve areas within the jurisdiction of other committees, it is recommended that each sponsoring committee invite one or more of such committees to be co-sponsors of the program. </li>
                       <li>The sponsoring committee should examine the legal issues to be addressed by the program and review the committee list to determine which, if any, committees might have an interest in the subject matter.  The Program Office will also suggest potential co-sponsoring committees and provide introductions, as needed. Please coordinate with those committees at an early stage in the planning process. The sponsoring committee is expected to coordinate the degree of participation by each co-sponsoring committee. Committees are encouraged to act as co-sponsors when requested.</li>
                       <li>Once a committee agrees to co-sponsor an event, it should not simply lend its name to the program flyer, but should fully cooperate with the sponsoring committee in maximizing attendance. Co-sponsors should encourage the attendance of their own members, use their best efforts to obtain the attendance of others (by making available mailing lists, emailing invitations and the like) and otherwise make their advice available to the sponsoring committee as requested. Co-sponsoring committees may also be of assistance in obtaining speakers for the program.</li>

The City Bar will work with you to determine registration fees for members and non-members based on your program's expenses.</p>
                        <p>One way to adjust cost is by sponsorships of program-related receptions (discussed below). Please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:mharris@nycbar.org">Martha Harris</a> if you have any questions regarding sponsorship. </p>

                      <p>Please keep in mind that the City Bar has a rich history in the sphere of public policy and legal reform, and we want to strike the difficult but appropriate balance between allowing sponsorships while, at the same time, not appearing to explicitly endorse an entity that stands to gain monetarily from the sponsorship. This is why we are thoughtful about seeking support for substantive programs.</p>
                      <p>Committees may acknowledge the generosity of the entities supporting an event in the event calendar listing, marketing emails, and both in a program handout distributed the day of the event and orally during the event.</p>
                      <p>Any revenue, including support from sponsors, that is received in excess of expenditures will be remitted to the Association for general use in developing the programs and work product of the City Bar committees. The Association may determine, in its sole discretion, that some or all excess revenue from a particular event shall be donated to one or more programs of the City Bar Fund (the Association's charitable arm).</p>
                      <p>Please also note, the New York City Bar Association is a 501(c)(6) organization. Program and event sponsorships paid to the Association are not tax-deductible charitable contributions.</p>

                      <p>Special efforts should be made to build the widest possible audience for your program. We rely heavily on e-mail notices and will send notice of your program to relevant City Bar committees and City Bar members who practice in or have expressed an interest in the relevant subject area. We also include program listings on our own web calendar, in the 44th Street eNews, and City Bar social media accounts. In addition, feel free to identify any specialized e-mail lists, listserves and other organizations that you or your committee members can provide.</p>
                      <p>Our experience has shown that the most effective way of drawing an audience for a program is direct communication between committee members and their colleagues and contacts. Remember, if each committee member brings two colleagues to a program that alone will place about 100 people in the audience. So please encourage committee members to distribute flyers or electronic notices at their firm or office and to organizations they know, and to email flyers or electronic notices to colleagues, and to promote on social media, perhaps with a &ldquo;hope you can come&rdquo; note on it.</p>

                      <ul>
                       <li>Have all devices fully charged and have an electrical socket and cable nearby should your battery die and you need to plug in. </li>
                       <li>Make sure you have a good internet connection so you don&rsquo;t drop-off. If you can, connect to the internet via an internet cable rather than by Wi-Fi. Zoom works on wireless connection but the quality is best on a wired internet connection</li>
                       <li>Test your video and audio before your meeting at zoom.us/test.</li>
                       <li>Try to use a headphone or earphones to prevent echoes and feedback.</li>
                       <li>If possible, try to use a good quality camera and headset instead of your computer&rsquo;s built-in ones. Zoom works fine with the built-ins, but the quality is even sharper with higher quality hardware.</li>
                       <li>Mute your mic when you aren&rsquo;t speaking to prevent/reduce background noise. </li>

                       <li>Unless your appearance or background is very inappropriate or distracting, turn ON your video. Video is crucial in creating an engaging virtual communication.</li>
                       <li>Have a simple background (a plain wall, a potted plant, or a bookshelf works perfectly). Zoom also provides virtual backgrounds if you need to disguise your environment.</li>
                       <li>Try to be in a room where people won&rsquo;t have to enter during the program and alert those you live with that you will be on a Zoom Webinar so they don&rsquo;t disturb you.</li>
                       <li>Position yourself so that most of the light is coming from in front of you (behind your monitor), instead of behind you. If you have a window behind you, shut the blinds. Otherwise, you will be back lit.</li>
                       <li>Try to center your head in the center of the frame.&nbsp; Adjust your camera if it is too low or high. Your camera should be at eye level. To achieve this you can also prop your computer up on books or adjust your seat. </li>
                       <li>Don&rsquo;t get too close. Position yourself so the camera is seeing you from the chest or waist up, instead of just seeing your face. This is more natural for the viewer. This is especially beneficial if you tend to gesture a lot.</li>
                       <li>Look at the camera when you are speaking.&nbsp; </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Engage Your Audience</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                       <li>Consider using engagement tools available on Zoom such as polls, share screen and Q&amp;A.</li>
                       <li>Share your screen, show PowerPoints, Websites and other documents.</li>
                       <li>Send out a poll. Please send your poll questions to us in advance of the program so they can be set-up.</li>
                       <li>Solicit feedback or invite questions via the Q&amp;A function.</li>

                      <p>The Board of Directors encourages committees to develop continuing legal education programs. The programs can range from introductions to substantive topics, to updates for experienced practitioners, to hands-on training and practicums to develop and hone legal skills. These efforts are coordinated through the Program Department. Its staff will work with committees to develop CLE programs. </p>
                      <p>With CLE mandatory for all New York lawyers and with the City Bar accredited in four states there has been great interest in attending programs where CLE credit is offered. In addition to live programs the City Bar reaches over 40,000 people through its online partners. Please note that no program for which CLE credit is to be offered may be conducted without coordinating with the Program Department. </p>
                      <p>When your committee begins to discuss a CLE program please follow these steps: </p>
                      <ul style="list-style:disc !important;">
                        <li>Complete the <a href="https://services.nycbar.org/Members/CLE/Upload_Program_Questionnaire.aspx">CLE Program Questionnaire</a>. Once the form is received it will be reviewed by the CLE Program staff and we will advise you whether the program is approved to be run as a City Bar CLE program. In some cases we may decide the program topic would be better as a regular program without CLE credit attached. </li>
                        <li>Once approved, our staff will work with you to choose a date for the CLE program. In general, CLE programs are scheduled for the Fall season (September through December) the prior May; CLE programs for the Winter/Spring season (January through June) are scheduled the prior October; and Summer programs (July and August) are scheduled the prior April. We try to save room in the schedule to move quickly on hot topics or timely topics as well. </li>
                        <li>Identify proposed panelists or speakers for the CLE program. Committees are urged to ensure that the faculty features a diverse array of speakers, including those of individuals with disabilities or who are from historically underrepresented groups.</li>
                        <li>Develop the program&rsquo;s agenda and schedule as early as possible. This enables the Program Department to make the necessary arrangements for announcing and advertising the program. </li>
                        <li>Work with the assigned staff attorney in refining the program agenda, obtaining written materials from the speakers and identifying the intended audience. The Program Department will be responsible for coordinating the program arrangements, including making space and catering reservations, advertising and announcing the program, collecting and editing the accompanying written materials. The City Bar Center will also run registration, collect evaluations and ensure MCLE compliance by: distributing CLE certificates, determining the CLE credit breakdown, filing the required information with the CLE Board and maintaining program records for the period required under the MCLE rules. </li>
                        <li>Please contact Martha Harris (212-382-6607 or <a href="mailto:mharris@nycbar.org">mharris@nycbar.org</a>) or Gregory Binstock (212-382-6763 or <a href="mailto:gbinstock@nycbar.org">gbinstock@nycbar.org</a>) if you have any questions or to discuss the initial planning of the program. They will be able to advise you re¬garding programs covering similar subject areas which have been held in the recent past or are planned for the future, and how the  Program Department can work with the committee on program development. </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Precise deadlines and more details regarding the foregoing will be set forth in written communications once the date of the program is secured and the program chair is appointed. </p>
